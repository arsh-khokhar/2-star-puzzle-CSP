The average difference in percentage between forward checking and backtracking is that
forward checking is 360% faster (460% the speed of) backtracking (note that this doesn't
include the tests that timed out, if we let those run to complete the increase would be
much higher). One examples that don't match up with this are when using heuristic 1
on the 8x8 grid, where backtracking actually ends up being faster, likely due to
overhead cost of forward checking. Another similar example is with heuristic 3
for the 14x14 grid, where we see similar results, although this might just be due
to the random nature of heuristic 3. Something interesting that happened during testing was that
heuristic 3 was actually faster than heuristic 1 on the 14x14 grid using forward checking (37 states!).
